**Notes**: 
- Without Tesseract: PDFs process but no OCR on image-based content
- Without LibreOffice: Office document processing will fail (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, OpenDocument formats)
- Without libmagic: File type detection relies on extensions, may show warnings
- All office formats are now processed through a unified processor with format-specific optimization

### Development Dependencies

- `pytest>=8.0.0` - Unit testing framework
- `pytest-cov>=6.2.1` - Code coverage reporting

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd folder-file-processor
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (Recommended: uv)

Using `uv` (automatically creates virtual environment and installs dependencies):

```bash
# Install uv if not already installed
# On macOS/Linux:
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# On Windows:
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Install all dependencies (creates .venv automatically)
uv sync

# Install with development dependencies
uv sync --group dev
```

### Alternative: Manual Virtual Environment Setup

If you prefer to use pip or don't have `uv` installed:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
# Or with development dependencies:
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your specific folder paths:

```env
# Required - Basic file processing
SOURCE_FOLDER=/path/to/your/source/folder
SAVED_FOLDER=/path/to/your/saved/folder
ERROR_FOLDER=/path/to/your/error/folder

# Optional - Advanced Document Processing with RAG
ENABLE_DOCUMENT_PROCESSING=true
DOCUMENT_PROCESSOR_TYPE=rag_store
MODEL_VENDOR=openai  # or google

# Required if using document processing
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here  # if MODEL_VENDOR=openai
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here  # if MODEL_VENDOR=google

# ChromaDB Configuration (choose embedded or client_server mode)
CHROMA_CLIENT_MODE=embedded  # or client_server
# For embedded mode:
CHROMA_DB_PATH=./data/chroma_db_openai
# For client_server mode:
CHROMA_SERVER_HOST=localhost
CHROMA_SERVER_PORT=8000
# Optional - Custom collection name for organizing documents
CHROMA_COLLECTION_NAME=my_documents

# Optional - OCR Investigation (for debugging OCR issues)
# OCR_INVESTIGATE=false
# OCR_INVESTIGATE_DIR=./ocr_debug
```

**Important Notes:**
- Use absolute paths for all folder configurations
- Ensure all specified folders exist or the application will create them
- The application user must have read/write permissions for all folders
- **Document Processing**: Requires API keys (OpenAI or Google) and optionally Tesseract OCR for image-based PDFs
- **OCR Investigation**: When enabled, saves OCR debug files to specified directory for troubleshooting
- **ChromaDB Modes**: Choose between embedded (file-based) or client_server (Docker-based) modes

### ChromaDB Server Setup (Optional)

For better performance and data persistence across application restarts, you can run ChromaDB as a server using Docker. The project includes convenient scripts for this.

#### Starting ChromaDB Server

```bash
# Navigate to project root and start the ChromaDB server
./setup_chromadb/chromadb-server.sh start

# Check server health
./setup_chromadb/chromadb-server.sh health

# View server logs
./setup_chromadb/chromadb-server.sh logs
```

#### Configuration for Client-Server Mode

Update your `.env` file to use client-server mode:

```env
CHROMA_CLIENT_MODE=client_server
CHROMA_SERVER_HOST=localhost
CHROMA_SERVER_PORT=8000
```

#### Server Management Commands

```bash
./setup_chromadb/chromadb-server.sh start      # Start server
./setup_chromadb/chromadb-server.sh stop       # Stop server
./setup_chromadb/chromadb-server.sh restart    # Restart server
./setup_chromadb/chromadb-server.sh status     # Show status
./setup_chromadb/chromadb-server.sh health     # Check health
./setup_chromadb/chromadb-server.sh logs       # View logs
./setup_chromadb/chromadb-server.sh clean      # Clean all data (DANGEROUS)
```

**Benefits of Client-Server Mode:**
- **Persistent Data**: Data survives application restarts
- **Better Performance**: Dedicated ChromaDB server process  
- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple applications can use the same ChromaDB instance
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes are immediately visible across all clients
- **Server Management**: Easy start/stop/restart of the database server

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
# If using uv:
uv run python main.py

# Or activate virtual environment first:
# On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

The application will:
1. Load configuration from `.env` file
2. Initialize all components (logging, file manager, processor, monitor)
3. **Process any existing files** already present in the source folder
4. Start monitoring the source folder for new files
5. Process files as they are detected
6. Continue running until stopped with Ctrl+C

### Application Output

When running, you'll see output similar to:

```
Folder File Processor starting...
Loading configuration...
Configuration loaded successfully:
  Source folder: /path/to/source
  Saved folder: /path/to/saved
  Error folder: /path/to/error
Setting up logging...

Processing existing file: reports/report.pdf
Initial scan processed 2 existing files
Monitoring folder: /path/to/source
Application is running. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

### Processing Output Examples

When files are processed, you'll see console output and log entries:

**Successful Processing with Folder Cleanup:**
```
Processed file: project1/data/document.txt
2025-01-15 10:30:15 - INFO - Successfully processed file: project1/data/document.txt
2025-01-15 10:30:15 - INFO - Cleaned up empty folder: project1/data
2025-01-15 10:30:15 - INFO - Cleaned up empty folder: project1
```

**Processing with Cleanup Warning:**
```
Processed file: shared/temp/file.txt
2025-01-15 10:30:20 - INFO - Successfully processed file: shared/temp/file.txt
2025-01-15 10:30:20 - WARNING - Could not remove empty folder /path/to/source/shared/temp: Permission denied
```

### File Processing Behavior

- **Successful Processing**: Files are moved to the `SAVED_FOLDER` with preserved directory structure
- **Failed Processing**: Files are moved to the `ERROR_FOLDER` with an accompanying `.log` file containing error details
- **Directory Structure**: Original folder hierarchy is maintained in both saved and error destinations
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Empty folders are automatically removed after successful file processing

#### Enhanced Error Logging

When files fail to process, the application creates detailed error log files with enhanced naming conventions:

**Error Log Filename Format**: `[original_filename].[original_extension].log`

**Examples of Error Log Naming:**
- `document.pdf` → `document.pdf.log`
- `data.csv` → `data.csv.log`
- `backup.tar.gz` → `backup.tar.gz.log`
- `report.xlsx` → `report.xlsx.log`
- `config.json` → `config.json.log`
- `script.py` → `script.py.log`
- `archive.zip` → `archive.zip.log`

**Error Log Placement:**
Error log files are placed in the same folder as the failed file within the error folder structure, maintaining the original directory hierarchy:

```
Error Folder Structure Example:
error/
├── project1/
│   ├── data/
│   │   ├── corrupted_file.txt      # Failed file
│   │   └── corrupted_file.txt.log  # Error log
│   └── reports/
│       ├── broken_report.pdf
│       └── broken_report.pdf.log
└── project2/
    ├── config.json
    └── config.json.log
```

**Error Log Content Format:**
```
Timestamp: 2025-01-23 10:30:45
File: /source/project1/data/corrupted_file.txt
Error: Permission denied when reading file
Stack Trace: [if applicable]
Additional Context: File size: 1024 bytes, Last modified: 2025-01-23 10:29:12
```

This enhanced error logging system ensures that:
- Each failed file has a uniquely identifiable error log
- Error logs are co-located with their corresponding failed files
- The original folder structure is preserved for easy navigation
- Detailed error information is captured for effective troubleshooting

#### Empty Folder Handling

The application automatically detects and handles completely empty folders found in the source directory:

**Empty Folder Detection Criteria:**
A folder is considered "completely empty" when it contains:
- **No files** (no regular files of any type)
- **No subfolders** (no subdirectories, empty or otherwise)

**Important**: Folders that contain empty subfolders are NOT considered completely empty and will not be moved.

**Empty Folder Processing Behavior:**
1. **Detection**: During monitoring, completely empty folders are identified
2. **Movement**: Empty folders are moved to the error folder with preserved directory structure
3. **Logging**: An `empty_folder.log` file is created inside the moved folder
4. **Integration**: Empty folder handling runs alongside regular file processing without interference

**Empty Folder Log Format:**
**Filename**: `empty_folder.log`
**Content Example**:
```
Timestamp: 2025-01-23 10:30:45
Folder: /source/project1/empty_directory
Reason: Completely empty folder detected (no files, no subfolders) and moved to error folder
Original Path: /source/project1/empty_directory
Moved To: /error/project1/empty_directory
```

**Empty Folder Structure Example:**
```
Before Processing:
source/
├── project1/
│   ├── data/
│   │   └── file.txt
│   ├── completely_empty/     # Will be moved (no files, no subfolders)
│   └── has_empty_subfolder/  # Will NOT be moved (contains subfolder)
│       └── empty_sub/
└── project2/
    └── another_empty/        # Will be moved (no files, no subfolders)

After Processing:
source/
├── project1/
│   └── has_empty_subfolder/  # Remains (not completely empty)
│       └── empty_sub/
└── # project2/ removed by cleanup (became empty after processing)

error/
├── project1/
│   └── completely_empty/
│       └── empty_folder.log
└── project2/
    └── another_empty/
        └empty_folder.log

saved/
└── project1/
    └── data/
        └── file.txt
```

**Integration with Regular Processing:**
- Empty folder detection runs during the initial source folder scan
- Does not interfere with file processing operations
- Operates independently of the automatic folder cleanup feature
- Logged at INFO level in the application log: `"Moved empty folder to error: /path/to/folder"`

#### Folder Cleanup Details

The application automatically cleans up empty folders after successfully processing files:

- **Empty Folder Detection**: Checks if folders contain no files or only empty subfolders
- **Recursive Cleanup**: Removes empty parent folders up to the source root
- **Safety Measures**: Never removes the source root folder, even if empty
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles permission errors during folder removal
- **Logging**: All folder cleanup operations are logged at INFO level

**Example Cleanup Behavior:**
```
Source structure before processing:
source/
├── project1/
│   ├── data/
│   │   └── file.txt
│   └── empty_folder/
└── project2/
    └── archive/
        └── old_file.txt

After processing file.txt and old_file.txt:
source/
├── project1/
│   └── empty_folder/  # Not removed (was already empty)
└── # project2/ removed (became empty after processing)
```

#### Race Condition Prevention

**Problem Resolved**: Previously, folders could be incorrectly flagged as "empty" when they became temporarily empty due to file processing, leading to spurious `empty_folder.log` files appearing alongside actual processed files.

**Solution Implemented**: The application now uses intelligent empty folder detection that prevents race conditions:

**Enhanced Empty Folder Logic:**
1. **Physical Emptiness Check**: First verifies the folder is actually empty
2. **Processing History Check**: Examines both saved and error folders for files that were previously processed from this location
3. **Smart Decision Making**: Only processes folders as "originally empty" if no processed files exist at equivalent paths

**Race Condition Scenarios Handled:**
- **Successful Processing**: If files were moved to the saved folder, the now-empty source folder is NOT treated as originally empty
- **Failed Processing**: If files were moved to the error folder, the now-empty source folder is NOT treated as originally empty  
- **Mixed Processing**: Handles combinations of successful and failed files from the same folder
- **Edge Cases**: Correctly ignores existing `empty_folder.log` files when making decisions

**Before Fix (Race Condition):**
```
1. Citation.doc fails processing → moved to error/Federal Law/TCPA/1992 FCC Order/
2. Source folder Federal Law/TCPA/1992 FCC Order/ becomes empty
3. Empty folder scanner detects "empty" folder → moves it to error folder
4. Result: Both Citation.doc AND empty_folder.log in same error location ❌
```

**After Fix (Race Condition Prevented):**
```
1. Citation.doc fails processing → moved to error/Federal Law/TCPA/1992 FCC Order/
2. Source folder Federal Law/TCPA/1992 FCC Order/ becomes empty  
3. Empty folder scanner detects empty folder BUT finds Citation.doc in error location
4. Result: Folder not processed as empty, no spurious empty_folder.log created ✅
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- `should_process_as_empty_folder()` method replaces simple emptiness checks
- Checks both `SAVED_FOLDER` and `ERROR_FOLDER` for processed files
- Preserves all existing functionality for truly empty folders
- Zero performance impact on normal file processing

### Stopping the Application

Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully stop the application. The system will:
1. Stop file monitoring
2. Complete any ongoing file operations
3. Clean up resources
4. Exit with appropriate status code

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

#### 1. Python Version Error
```
ERROR: This package requires Python >=3.12
```
**Solution**: Ensure you're using Python 3.12 or higher:
```bash
python --version
# If needed, install Python 3.12+ or use pyenv/conda
```

#### 2. Missing .env File
```
ERROR: Configuration validation failed: Missing required environment variables
```
**Solution**: Create `.env` file from example:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual folder paths
```

#### 3. Permission Denied Errors
```
ERROR: Permission denied when accessing folder: /path/to/folder
```
**Solution**: Ensure the application has read/write permissions:
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la /path/to/folder
# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 755 /path/to/folder
```

#### 4. Folder Not Found Errors
```
ERROR: Source folder does not exist: /path/to/source
```
**Solution**: Create the required folders:
```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/source /path/to/saved /path/to/error
```

#### 5. OCR/Tesseract Installation Issues
```
ERROR: TesseractNotFoundError: tesseract is not installed or it's not in your PATH
```
**Solution**: Install Tesseract OCR engine:
```bash
# macOS
brew install tesseract

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install tesseract

# Or download Windows installer from:
# https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
```

**Verify Installation**:
```bash
# Check if Tesseract is properly installed
tesseract --version

# Should output something like: tesseract 5.x.x
```

#### 6. Document Processing Configuration Issues
```
ERROR: Document processor validation failed
```
**Common solutions**:
- **Missing API Keys**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- **Invalid Model Vendor**: Set `MODEL_VENDOR=openai` or `MODEL_VENDOR=google`
- **ChromaDB Path Issues**: Ensure `CHROMA_DB_PATH` directory is writable
- **OCR Dependencies**: Install pytesseract and Pillow: `pip install pytesseract Pillow`

### Common Runtime Issues

#### 1. File Processing Failures
- **Check logs**: Look in `logs/application.log` for detailed error information
- **Check error folder**: Failed files are moved to `ERROR_FOLDER` with `.log` files containing details
- **Verify permissions**: Ensure files are readable and folders are writable

#### 2. Monitoring Not Working
- **Check source folder**: Ensure the source folder exists and is accessible
- **Check file system events**: Some network drives may not support file system events
- **Restart application**: Stop with Ctrl+C and restart

#### 3. High Memory Usage
- **Large files**: The application loads files into memory for processing
- **Many files**: Processing many files simultaneously can increase memory usage
- **Solution**: Monitor file sizes and consider implementing streaming for large files

#### 4. Folder Cleanup Issues
- **Permission Errors**: If folder cleanup fails due to permissions, check folder ownership and access rights
- **Folders Not Removed**: Only empty folders are removed; folders with hidden files or system files will remain
- **Network Drives**: Folder cleanup may behave differently on network-mounted drives
- **Check Logs**: Folder cleanup operations and any errors are logged at INFO/WARNING levels

**Folder Cleanup Log Messages:**
```
INFO - Cleaned up empty folder: project1/data
WARNING - Could not remove empty folder /path/to/folder: Permission denied
```

#### 5. Empty Folder Handling Issues

**Empty Folders Not Being Moved:**
- **Check Criteria**: Ensure folders are completely empty (no files AND no subfolders)
- **Hidden Files**: Folders with hidden files are not considered empty (though system files like `.DS_Store` are automatically deleted)
- **System Files**: Most system files are automatically deleted, but some folders may contain other metadata that prevents movement
- **Permissions**: Verify the application has read access to check folder contents

**Empty Folder Movement Failures:**
```
ERROR: Failed to move empty folder: Permission denied
```
**Solutions:**
- Check folder permissions and ownership
- Ensure the error folder is writable
- Verify no processes are using the folder

**Missing empty_folder.log Files:**
- **Check Error Folder**: Log files are created inside the moved empty folders
- **Permission Issues**: Verify write permissions in the error folder
- **Check Application Logs**: Look for error messages about log file creation

**Empty Folder Detection Confusion:**
```
Expected empty folder to be moved but it wasn't:
folder/
├── subfolder/  # Even if empty, parent is not "completely empty"
```
**Understanding**: Only folders with absolutely no contents (no files, no subfolders) are moved.

**Empty Folder Log Messages:**
```
INFO - Moved empty folder to error: /source/project1/empty_dir
INFO - Created empty folder log: /error/project1/empty_dir/empty_folder.log
WARNING - Failed to move empty folder /source/folder: Permission denied
```

#### 6. OCR and Document Processing Issues

**OCR Not Working on Image-based PDFs:**
```
INFO - Page 1 has minimal text (0 chars), attempting enhanced extraction
WARNING - Page 1 has no text and OCR not available. Install pytesseract and Tesseract for image OCR
```
**Solutions**:
- Install Tesseract OCR engine (see installation instructions above)
- Install Python dependencies: `pip install pytesseract Pillow`
- Verify Tesseract is in your system PATH: `tesseract --version`

**OCR Investigation Mode:**
Enable OCR debugging to troubleshoot OCR issues:
```env
# In .env file
OCR_INVESTIGATE=true
OCR_INVESTIGATE_DIR=./ocr_debug
```
This creates debug files showing OCR extraction results for each page processed.

**Word Document Processing:**
```
INFO - Document processing started: WordProcessor for /path/to/document.doc
convert /path/to/document.doc as a Writer document -> /tmp/document.docx using filter: MS Word 2007 XML
```
- **Legacy .doc Support**: UnstructuredLoader automatically converts .doc files to .docx format for processing
- **Metadata Cleaning**: Complex metadata from UnstructuredLoader is filtered for ChromaDB compatibility
- **Both Formats**: Supports both .doc (Word 97-2003) and .docx (Word 2007+) formats seamlessly

**Retry Mechanism and Error Recovery:**
The application includes intelligent retry logic for transient errors, particularly API timeouts:

```
INFO - File processing failed on attempt 1 (transient error), retrying in 1.0s: Error embedding content: 504 Deadline Exceeded
INFO - File processing failed on attempt 2 (transient error), retrying in 2.0s: Error embedding content: 504 Deadline Exceeded
INFO - File processing completed successfully on attempt 3
```

**Retry Configuration:**
- **Max Attempts**: 3 retries per file
- **Exponential Backoff**: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s delays (capped at 10s maximum)
- **Smart Classification**: Distinguishes between permanent errors (no retry) and transient errors (retry with backoff)
- **Automatic Retry**: Google API timeouts (504 Deadline Exceeded), network errors, rate limits, and temporary service issues

**Transient Errors (Will Retry):**
- API rate limits and quota exceeded
- Connection timeouts and network errors
- Google embedding API timeouts (504 Deadline Exceeded)
- ChromaDB temporary issues
- Service unavailable errors

**Permanent Errors (No Retry):**
- Unsupported file types
- Corrupted or malformed files
- Invalid document structure
- Authentication/API key issues

**Document Processing Performance Issues:**
- **Large PDFs**: OCR processing can be slow for large image-based PDFs  
- **API Timeouts**: Large documents may timeout during embedding generation (automatically retried up to 3 times)
- **Word Document Conversion**: Legacy .doc files require temporary conversion which may take extra time
- **High Memory Usage**: OCR operations use significant memory for image processing
- **Solutions**: 
  - Process files in smaller batches
  - Increase available system memory
  - Monitor `logs/application.log` for processing times and retry attempts
  - Large files may take up to ~3-4 minutes total with retries

**ChromaDB Connection Issues:**
```
ERROR: Could not initialize ChromaDB at path: ./data/chroma_db_openai
```
**Solutions**:
- Ensure `CHROMA_DB_PATH` directory exists and is writable
- Check disk space availability
- Verify no other processes are using the database

**ChromaDB Client-Server Mode Issues:**
```
ERROR: Failed to connect to ChromaDB server at localhost:8000
```
**Solutions**:
- Ensure ChromaDB server is running: `./setup_chromadb/chromadb-server.sh status`
- Start the server if stopped: `./setup_chromadb/chromadb-server.sh start`
- Check server health: `./setup_chromadb/chromadb-server.sh health`
- Verify `CHROMA_CLIENT_MODE=client_server` in `.env`
- Confirm correct host and port in `.env` file

**ChromaDB Collection Configuration:**
- **Collection Name**: Use `CHROMA_COLLECTION_NAME` to organize documents by project or category
- **Multiple Collections**: Different applications can use different collection names on the same server
- **Collection Persistence**: Collections in client-server mode survive application restarts
- **Collection Access**: Verify collection name matches between configuration and expectations

### Getting Help

1. **Check logs**: Always check `logs/application.log` for detailed error information
2. **Run tests**: Execute the test suite to verify system functionality
3. **Verify configuration**: Ensure `.env` file has correct paths and permissions
4. **Check dependencies**: Verify all required packages are installed

### Debug Mode

For additional debugging information, you can modify the logging level in the application:

```python
# In src/services/logger_service.py, change logging level to DEBUG
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

This will provide more detailed information about file operations and system events.
