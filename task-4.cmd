REM TASK 4: Consolidate Existing GHCR Implementation
REM ==============================================
REM 
REM STATUS: [ ] PENDING  [ ] IN PROGRESS  [ ] COMPLETED
REM 
REM OBJECTIVE: 
REM Migrate existing docker_deployment_from_ghcr/ functionality into the new
REM docker_deployment/ci/ structure while preserving all sophisticated logic.
REM 
REM ACTIONS:
REM 0. Ensure on refactor/build branch (created in Task 1)
REM    git checkout refactor/docker-deployment-reorganization
REM 
REM 1. Compare existing docker_deployment_from_ghcr/ with new ci/ implementation
REM    - Identify any missing functionality in new ci/ scripts
REM    - Compare docker-compose configurations
REM    - Check for differences in environment handling
REM 
REM 2. Migrate superior functionality from docker_deployment_from_ghcr/
REM    - Update ci/deploy-from-ghcr.sh with any missing features
REM    - Update ci/deploy-from-ghcr.bat with any missing features
REM    - Enhance ci/docker-compose.yml if needed
REM 
REM 3. Preserve existing configuration compatibility
REM    - Ensure existing config files work with new structure
REM    - Validate GHCR repository references are correct
REM    - Maintain image tag and vendor selection functionality
REM 
REM 4. Test migration thoroughly
REM    - Deploy using new ci/ scripts
REM    - Compare with docker_deployment_from_ghcr/ deployment
REM    - Verify identical functionality and behavior
REM 
REM 5. Create migration notes
REM    - Document what was migrated and why
REM    - Note any breaking changes (should be none)
REM    - Provide migration guide for users
REM 
REM FILES TO EXAMINE:
REM - docker_deployment_from_ghcr/deploy-ghcr.sh
REM - docker_deployment_from_ghcr/deploy-ghcr.bat  
REM - docker_deployment_from_ghcr/docker-compose.yml
REM - docker_deployment_from_ghcr/config/*.json
REM 
REM FILES TO UPDATE:
REM - docker_deployment/ci/deploy-from-ghcr.sh (enhance with missing features)
REM - docker_deployment/ci/deploy-from-ghcr.bat (enhance with missing features)
REM - docker_deployment/ci/docker-compose.yml (enhance if needed)
REM 
REM VALIDATION:
REM - New ci/ deployment produces identical results to docker_deployment_from_ghcr/
REM - All existing GHCR functionality preserved
REM - Configuration files work with new structure
REM - No regression in deployment reliability
REM - Image pulling and container startup identical
REM - Environment generation produces same results
REM 
REM DEPENDENCIES: Task 1 (shared infrastructure), Task 2 (CI path created)
REM BLOCKS: Task 5 (cleanup can't happen until this is complete)
REM 
REM ESTIMATED TIME: 60 minutes
