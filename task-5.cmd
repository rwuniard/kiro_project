REM to reflect the new two-path deployment architecture.
REM 
REM ACTIONS:
REM 0. Ensure on refactor/build branch (created in Task 1)
REM    git checkout refactor/docker-deployment-reorganization
REM 
REM 1. Remove redundant files from docker_deployment/ root
REM    - Remove docker_deployment/deploy-local.sh (replaced by local/build-and-deploy.sh)
REM    - Remove docker_deployment/deploy-local.bat (replaced by local/build-and-deploy.bat)
REM    - Remove docker_deployment/docker-compose.yml (replaced by ci/ and local/ versions)
REM    - Remove docker_deployment/docker-compose.override.yml (if exists)
REM    - Remove docker_deployment/fix-permissions.sh (logic moved to scripts)
REM    - Remove empty directories: docker_deployment/scripts/, docker_deployment/config/
REM 
REM 2. Remove docker_deployment_from_ghcr/ directory entirely
REM    - All functionality migrated to docker_deployment/ci/
REM    - rm -rf docker_deployment_from_ghcr/
REM 
REM 3. Update CLAUDE.md documentation
REM    - Replace Docker Development Commands section
REM    - Document two deployment paths clearly:
REM      * CI Deployment: Pull from GHCR
REM      * Local Development: Build and deploy locally
REM    - Update command examples for both paths
REM    - Update troubleshooting section
REM 
REM 4. Update project README if exists
REM    - Update deployment instructions
REM    - Add clear choice guidance between CI and local paths
REM 
REM 5. Create deployment choice guide
REM    - When to use CI deployment (quick start, production-like)
REM    - When to use local deployment (development, debugging, offline)
REM    - Migration guide from old scripts
REM 
REM FILES TO REMOVE:
REM - docker_deployment/deploy-local.sh
REM - docker_deployment/deploy-local.bat
REM - docker_deployment/docker-compose.yml
REM - docker_deployment/docker-compose.override.yml
REM - docker_deployment/fix-permissions.sh
REM - docker_deployment/scripts/ (directory, after contents moved)
REM - docker_deployment/config/ (directory, after contents moved)
REM - docker_deployment_from_ghcr/ (entire directory)
REM 
REM FILES TO UPDATE:
REM - CLAUDE.md (Docker Development Commands section)
REM - README.md (if exists)
REM 
REM NEW DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE:
REM - Clear explanation of CI vs Local deployment paths
REM - Command examples for both Unix/Mac and Windows
REM - Troubleshooting for both deployment types
REM - Migration guide from old deployment scripts
REM 
REM VALIDATION:
REM - All redundant files successfully removed
REM - No broken references or missing files
REM - Documentation accurately reflects new structure
REM - Both deployment paths clearly documented
REM - Examples work for both platforms
