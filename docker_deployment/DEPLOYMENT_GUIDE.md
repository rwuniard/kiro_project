# Docker Deployment Choice Guide

## 🤔 Which Deployment Path Should I Choose?

This guide helps you choose between **CI Deployment** and **Local Development** based on your specific needs and situation.

---

## 🚀 CI Deployment (Pre-built Images)

### ✅ Choose CI Deployment When:

**Quick Start & Testing**
- ✅ You want to get started immediately (2-minute setup)
- ✅ You're evaluating the project or running demos
- ✅ You need a production-like environment for testing
- ✅ You're setting up for QA or staging environments

**Stable Environment**
- ✅ You want consistent, tested images 
- ✅ You need predictable behavior across deployments
- ✅ You're not actively developing/modifying the code
- ✅ You're deploying to multiple environments consistently

**Resource Constraints**
- ✅ You have limited local disk space
- ✅ You have a slower development machine
- ✅ You want minimal local dependencies
- ✅ You prefer not to install build tools locally

**Team Scenarios**
- ✅ Multiple team members need identical environments
- ✅ Non-developers need to run the system (PM, QA, etc.)
- ✅ You're running integration tests in CI/CD pipelines
- ✅ You need to quickly reproduce reported issues

### ❌ Don't Choose CI Deployment When:
- ❌ You need to modify the application code
- ❌ You're debugging complex issues requiring code changes
- ❌ You work offline frequently
- ❌ You need to test experimental features or configurations

---

## 🔧 Local Development (Build from Source)

### ✅ Choose Local Development When:

**Active Development**
- ✅ You're actively modifying application code
- ✅ You're implementing new features
- ✅ You're debugging issues and need to test fixes immediately
- ✅ You're experimenting with different configurations

**Full Control**
- ✅ You need to modify the Dockerfile or build process
- ✅ You want to customize the container environment
- ✅ You need to test with different dependency versions
- ✅ You're working on the Docker deployment itself

**Offline Development**
- ✅ You work in environments with limited internet
- ✅ You need guaranteed availability regardless of external services
- ✅ You're working in secure/isolated environments
- ✅ You want full independence from external registries

**Learning & Understanding**
- ✅ You want to understand how the system is built
- ✅ You're learning Docker and containerization
- ✅ You need to troubleshoot build-related issues
- ✅ You're contributing to the project's build process

### ❌ Don't Choose Local Development When:
- ❌ You just want to quickly test the application
- ❌ You have limited disk space or slow internet
- ❌ You don't want to install build dependencies
- ❌ You need consistent environments across a team

## 📊 Decision Matrix

| Criteria | CI Deployment | Local Development | Winner |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Setup Speed** | ⚡ 2 minutes | ⏱️ 5-10 minutes | CI |
| **Code Changes** | ❌ Requires new image | ✅ Immediate | Local |
| **Disk Usage** | 💾 ~2GB | 💾 ~5GB | CI |
| **Build Control** | ❌ Pre-built only | ✅ Full control | Local |
| **Offline Work** | ❌ Needs internet | ✅ Works offline | Local |
| **Consistency** | ✅ Guaranteed | ⚠️ Depends on env | CI |
| **Debugging** | 🔍 Logs only | 🛠️ Full access | Local |
| **Team Sync** | ✅ Same image | ⚠️ Build variations | CI |

## 🎯 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "I'm new to the project and want to see it work"
**Recommendation**: CI Deployment
- Quick setup, no build complexity
- Focus on understanding functionality first

### Scenario 2: "I need to fix a bug in the file processor"
**Recommendation**: Local Development
- Need to modify code and test immediately
- Require debugging capabilities

### Scenario 3: "Setting up staging environment for testing"
**Recommendation**: CI Deployment
- Production-like consistency
- Known stable image versions

### Scenario 4: "Working on a plane/remote location"
**Recommendation**: Local Development
- No internet dependency after initial setup
- Full local control

### Scenario 5: "Team needs identical test environments"
**Recommendation**: CI Deployment
- Everyone gets exactly the same container
- No build environment variations

### Scenario 6: "Developing new document processing features"
**Recommendation**: Local Development
- Need immediate feedback on code changes
- May require container environment modifications

## 🔄 Migration Between Deployment Types

### From CI to Local Development
```bash
# If you started with CI but need to develop:
cd docker_deployment/ci && docker-compose down
cd ../local && ./build-and-deploy.sh
# Your data (chroma_db, logs) is preserved
```

### From Local to CI Development
```bash
# If you were developing but want stable environment:
cd docker_deployment/local && docker-compose down
cd ../ci && ./deploy-from-ghcr.sh
# Your data (chroma_db, logs) is preserved
```

**Note**: Both deployment types share the same data volumes, so switching between them preserves your ChromaDB data and logs.

## ⚡ Quick Decision Tree

```
Do you need to modify application code?
├─ YES → Local Development
└─ NO
   └─ Do you need this running quickly (< 5 min)?
      ├─ YES → CI Deployment
      └─ NO
         └─ Will you be working offline?
            ├─ YES → Local Development  
            └─ NO → CI Deployment (recommended)
```

## 🎓 Learning Path Recommendation

**For New Users**:
1. Start with **CI Deployment** to understand the application
2. Explore functionality and file processing
3. Switch to **Local Development** when you need to modify code
4. Use CI Deployment for stable testing after development

**For Developers**:
1. Use **Local Development** for daily development work
2. Switch to **CI Deployment** for testing releases
3. Use CI Deployment for reproducing user-reported issues

## 🆘 Still Unsure?

**Default Recommendation**: Start with **CI Deployment**
- Fastest way to get started
- Helps you understand the application first
- You can always switch to Local Development later
- Your data will be preserved when switching
