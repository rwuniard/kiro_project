# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Python application that monitors a configurable source folder for new files, processes them, and moves them to appropriate destination folders based on processing results. The application uses file system events for real-time monitoring and maintains folder structure preservation during file operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure source and destination folders via environment variables, so that I can easily deploy the application in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL read the source folder path from a .env file
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL read the saved folder path from a .env file  
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL read the error folder path from a .env file
4. IF any required environment variables are missing THEN the application SHALL exit with a clear error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to monitor the source folder for new files using file system events, so that files are processed immediately when added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL set up file system event monitoring on the source folder and all subfolders
2. WHEN a new file is created in the source folder THEN the application SHALL trigger processing immediately
3. WHEN a new file is created in a subfolder THEN the application SHALL trigger processing immediately
4. IF the file system event monitoring fails THEN the application SHALL log an error and exit gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want files to be processed and then moved to a saved folder with preserved folder structure, so that processed files are organized and traceable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is successfully processed THEN the application SHALL move it to the saved folder
2. WHEN moving a file to the saved folder THEN the application SHALL preserve the original folder structure relative to the source folder
3. IF the destination folder structure doesn't exist THEN the application SHALL create the necessary directories
4. WHEN the file move is complete THEN the application SHALL print to screen what file has been processed
5. WHEN a file is successfully processed THEN the application SHALL log the processing success at INFO level in the application log

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want failed files to be moved to an error folder with detailed error logging, so that I can troubleshoot and fix issues later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file fails to read or process THEN the application SHALL move it to the error folder
2. WHEN moving a failed file to the error folder THEN the application SHALL preserve the original folder structure relative to the source folder
3. WHEN a file fails processing THEN the application SHALL create an error log file with the same filename but with .log extension
4. WHEN creating an error log THEN it SHALL contain detailed information about the error encountered including timestamp and error message
5. WHEN a file fails to process THEN the application SHALL log the processing failure at INFO level in the application log

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to handle file processing gracefully with proper error handling, so that the system remains stable and continues monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a file THEN the application SHALL attempt to read and process the file contents
2. IF a file cannot be read due to permissions or corruption THEN the application SHALL handle the error gracefully and continue monitoring
3. WHEN file processing is successful THEN the application SHALL continue monitoring for new files
4. IF any file operation fails THEN the application SHALL log the error but continue running to process other files
5. WHEN any anomaly or error occurs in the application THEN it SHALL be logged at ERROR level in the application log

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want empty folders to be automatically cleaned up after all files are moved, so that the source folder structure remains clean and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all files in a folder have been successfully moved to the saved folder THEN the application SHALL check if the folder is empty
2. WHEN a folder contains no files and no subfolders with files THEN the application SHALL remove the empty folder
3. WHEN removing empty folders THEN the application SHALL recursively check parent folders and remove them if they become empty
4. WHEN an empty folder is removed THEN the application SHALL log the folder removal at INFO level in the application log
5. IF a folder cannot be removed due to permissions or system restrictions THEN the application SHALL log a warning but continue processing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests that cover all scenarios, so that I can ensure the application works correctly and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN they SHALL cover all file processing scenarios including successful processing
2. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN they SHALL cover all error handling scenarios including file read failures and permission errors
3. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN they SHALL verify folder structure preservation for both saved and error folders
4. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN they SHALL test environment variable configuration and error log creation functionality
5. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN they SHALL test empty folder cleanup functionality including recursive parent folder removal
