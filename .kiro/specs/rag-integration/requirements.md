# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the existing RAG store functionality with the folder file processor application. The integration allows the application to automatically process files through the RAG store's document processing pipeline when files are detected in the source folder. Files that can be processed by the RAG store (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD) will be converted to embeddings and stored in ChromaDB, while maintaining the existing file movement and error handling behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want files to be automatically processed through the RAG store when they are detected in the source folder, so that document content is indexed for semantic search capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is detected in the source folder THEN the system SHALL check if the file type is supported by the RAG store processors
2. IF the file type is supported by RAG store THEN the system SHALL process the file through the RAG store pipeline before moving it to the saved folder
3. WHEN RAG processing is successful THEN the system SHALL store the document embeddings in ChromaDB and move the file to the saved folder
4. WHEN RAG processing fails THEN the system SHALL log the RAG-specific error and move the file to the error folder with enhanced error information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the document processing system to be modular and pluggable, so that I can easily replace the RAG store with other processing systems in the future without changing the core application logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load the configured document processing module through a pluggable interface
2. IF no document processing module is configured THEN the system SHALL log an error and terminate the application
3. WHEN a new document processing system needs to be integrated THEN it SHALL implement the standard document processor interface
4. IF the configured document processing module fails to load THEN the system SHALL log the error and terminate the application

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want detailed logging of RAG processing operations, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the document indexing process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is processed through RAG store THEN the system SHALL log the processing start, progress, and completion with structured logging
2. WHEN RAG processing creates embeddings THEN the system SHALL log the number of chunks created and the ChromaDB collection used
3. WHEN RAG processing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including processor type and failure reason
4. WHEN RAG processing is skipped for unsupported files THEN the system SHALL log the file type and reason for skipping

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want document processing to handle errors gracefully at the file level while ensuring system integrity, so that individual file failures don't compromise the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document processing fails for a file THEN the system SHALL continue processing other files without interruption
2. IF the document processing system initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and terminate the application
3. WHEN ChromaDB or other storage systems are unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and move files to error folder with appropriate error logs
4. IF document processing times out THEN the system SHALL terminate the operation and treat it as a processing failure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all files to be processed through the document processing system, so that the application has a single, consistent processing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is detected in the source folder THEN the system SHALL attempt to process it through the configured document processing system
2. IF document processing is successful THEN the file SHALL be moved to the saved folder
3. IF document processing fails THEN the file SHALL be moved to the error folder with detailed error information
4. WHEN a file type is not supported by the document processing system THEN it SHALL be treated as a processing failure and moved to the error folder

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want document processing to use the existing configuration management system, so that processing settings are managed consistently with other application settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads configuration THEN document processing settings SHALL be loaded from environment variables or configuration files
2. IF required document processing environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL log appropriate errors and terminate the application
3. WHEN document processing configuration changes THEN the system SHALL be able to reload the configuration without requiring a full restart
4. WHEN document processing is enabled THEN the system SHALL validate that required dependencies (ChromaDB, embedding models) are available

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for the document processing integration, so that I can ensure the system works correctly and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document processing integration is implemented THEN unit tests SHALL be created to test the integration layer
2. WHEN document processing succeeds or fails THEN unit tests SHALL verify the correct file movement and logging behavior
3. WHEN the pluggable document processor interface is implemented THEN unit tests SHALL verify interface compliance
4. IF document processing configuration is invalid THEN unit tests SHALL verify proper error handling and application termination

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want updated documentation that explains the document processing integration, so that I can understand and configure the system properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document processing integration is implemented THEN the README SHALL be updated to explain the new processing workflow
2. WHEN configuration options are added THEN the documentation SHALL include examples of environment variable settings
3. WHEN troubleshooting scenarios occur THEN the documentation SHALL include common issues and solutions for document processing
4. IF the system architecture changes THEN the documentation SHALL reflect the new modular document processing design
